- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Bluetec86

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: Too many things to list here, but its safe to say Linus is one of them.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Setting up Arch the way that I want with Awesome window manager, may explore XMonad at some point, need to learn how to work with
Haskell a bit to get that right. Lua right now is what Im thrashing with in Awesome.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Best way to get ahold of me is either through Discord, Bluetec#9236 or my email which is kyle.tharpe@protonmail.com
